        <p>Sanctuary is a word derived from the Latin sanctuarium, which is, like most words ending in -arium, a container for keeping something inâ€”in this case holy things or perhaps cherished people (sanctae/sancti). The meaning was extended to places
            of holiness or safety, in particular the whole demarcated area, often many acres, surrounding a Greek or Roman temple; the original terms for these are temenos in Greek and fanum in Latin, but both may be translated as "sanctuary". Similar
            usage may be sometimes found describing sacred areas in other religions. In Christian churches sanctuary has a specific meaning, covering part of the interior, covered below. A sanctuary, in its original meaning, is a sacred place, such as
            a shrine. By the use of such places as a haven, by extension the term has come to be used for any place of safety. This secondary use can be categorized into human sanctuary, a safe place for people, such as a political sanctuary; and non-human
            sanctuary, such as an animal or plant sanctuary. The concepts of sanctuary and asylum are defined very similarly at their most basic level. Both terms involve the granting of safety or protection from some type of danger, often implied to
            be a persecuting, oppressive power. The divergence between these terms stems primarily from their societal associations and legal standing; while asylum understood in its political sense implies legally-binding protection on the part of a
            state entity, sanctuary often takes the form of moral and ethical activism that calls into question decisions made by the institutions in power.
