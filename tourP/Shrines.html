        <p>A shrine (Latin: scrinium "case or chest for books or papers"; Old French: escrin "box or case")is a sacred or holy space dedicated to a specific deity, ancestor, hero, martyr, saint, daemon, or similar figure of respect, wherein they are venerated
            or worshipped. Shrines often contain idols, relics, or other such objects associated with the figure being venerated. A shrine at which votive offerings are made is called an altar. Shrines are found in many of the world's religions, including
            Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese folk religion, Shinto, indigenous Philippine folk religions, and Asatru as well as in secular and non-religious settings such as a war memorial. Shrines can be found in various settings, such
            as churches, temples, cemeteries, museums, or in the home. However, portable shrines are also found in some cultures.Many shrines are located within buildings and in the temples designed specifically for worship, such as a church in Christianity,
            or a mandir in Hinduism. A shrine here is usually the center of attention in the building and is given a place of prominence. In such cases, adherents of the faith assemble within the building in order to venerate the deity at the shrine.
            In classical temple architecture, the shrine may be synonymous with the cella.
