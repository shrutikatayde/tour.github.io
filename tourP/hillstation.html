        <p>The hill stations are high-altitude towns for recreation, enjoyment and used as a place of refuge to escape the blistering heat in India during summertime. As India is a vast country with limited amounts of the coastal area most of its towns and
            districts face continental type of climate with summer being very hot so hill stations (as situated on high altitude due to which it faces low temperature) becomes an excellent spot to escape such hot and humid conditions as well as a place
            of enjoyment to spent quality time with your family and partner during summer break.The Indian subcontinent has seven principal mountain ranges and the largest of all is the Himalayas that lies in the northern part of India. The famous peaks
            and ranges include the Kangchenjunga range in the Eastern Himalayas which frames the hill stations of Darjeeling and Gangtok as well as the Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand. The Shivalik range that also lies within the same region also has some famous
            hill stations that include Mussoorie, Drass, Dalhousie, Kullu, Shimla, Nainital and many more.Most of the hill stations in India were developed by the British around a central mall to get respite from the oppressive summer heat. Many have
            picturesque lakes as their focal point, making them excellent places for boating activities. Most of the hill stations in India are located in the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, West Bengal,
            Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Meghalaya in the Himalayas and in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu in Western ghats.Some are located in Eastern ghats of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West
            Bengal. Some of the hill stations in India are listed below by state.Hill stations in British India were established for a variety of reasons. One of the first reasons in the early 1800s, was for the place to act as a sanitorium for the ailing
            family members of British officials.
